>The topology for this lab. There is area 0 directly connected to area 23, area 25 and area 51. Area 51 is a totally stub area. Area 23 has another area connected away from area 0, working as a linker.
## Objective

The objective of the practice is to configure multi-area OSPF in a topology of seven routers, ensuring total convergence and connectivity between all VPCs. Area 51 should be implemented as Total Stub, Virtual Links should be configured when necessary and routing tables should be validated. In addition, DR/BDR will be identified.
